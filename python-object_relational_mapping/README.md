# Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Project

This project is focused on learning and implementing Object Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python. ORM is a technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using object-oriented programming concepts. It provides a convenient way to map database tables to classes, and allows for seamless interaction between the application and the database.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of ORM and its benefits. By working on this project, I aim to learn how to effectively use ORM to simplify database operations, improve code maintainability, and enhance overall productivity.

## Technologies

- Python
- ORM framework (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Explore the provided examples and documentation.
4. Start implementing your own ORM-based functionality.
5. Experiment with different database operations and queries.
6. Test and validate your code against the database.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!

## Resources

Here are some helpful resources to learn more about ORM:

- [SQLAlchemy Documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/)
